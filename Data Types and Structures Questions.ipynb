        "\n",
        "    Key characteristics of how dictionaries store data:\n",
        "\n",
        "  •\tKey-Value Pairs:\n",
        "Each piece of data in a dictionary consists of a unique key and its associated value. The key acts as an identifier for retrieving the value.\n",
        "\n",
        "  •\tHashing:            \n",
        "When a key-value pair is added to a dictionary, the key is passed through a hash function. This function generates an integer hash value, which is then used to determine the memory location (or \"bucket\") where the key-value pair will be stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "  •  Collision Handling:\n",
        "Multiple keys might produce the same hash value (a \"collision\"). Python's dictionary implementation handles these collisions, typically using techniques like open addressing or separate chaining, to ensure that each key can still be uniquely identified and its corresponding value retrieved.\n",
        "\n",
        " •  Unordered (Historically):\n",
        "In Python versions prior to 3.7, dictionaries were inherently unordered, meaning the order in which items were inserted was not preserved. As of Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain insertion order.\n",
        "\n",
        " •  Mutable:\n",
        "Dictionaries are mutable, allowing for the addition, modification, and deletion of key-value pairs after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "•  Immutable Keys:\n",

One example would be storing the age of school students. You could store the age and name as a value and key pair.
